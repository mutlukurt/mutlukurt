# Hi, I'm Mutlu Kurt 👋

I’m Mutlu — a **Vibe Coder** who blends structured thinking with creative flow to build products that are fast, clean, and scalable.  
Instead of relying only on manual coding or drag-and-drop tools, I work side-by-side with AI to bring ideas to life quickly — without sacrificing quality.

I specialize in:
- **React Native (Expo)** for mobile apps  
- **Tailwind CSS** for sleek, responsive UIs  
- **Prompt Engineering** to guide AI in writing code, logic, and design  

For me, development isn’t just about code — it’s about turning concepts into real, usable products that people enjoy using.  
I’m currently building my own projects and always open to collaborations that value creativity, innovation, and speed.

If you’ve got something ambitious in mind, let’s make it happen.

## 🚀 What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a hybrid way of building software — not pure no-code, not full traditional coding.  
It’s about **working with AI and visual tools** through logic, structure, and flow to create real, production-ready applications — faster than ever.

As a **Vibe Coder**, I:
- Generate frontend code and logic via **structured prompts**  
- Build MVPs, dashboards, and mobile apps in record time  
- Focus on usability, accessibility, and clarity — not just syntax  
- Bridge **creativity** with **technical execution**

## 💡 What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** means crafting clear, structured instructions that guide AI to perform developer-level tasks.  
I use it to:
- Build working React components and logic from natural language  
- Design UIs directly through prompts and flow-based editors  
- Automate repetitive dev tasks  
- Turn ideas into working products — fast
