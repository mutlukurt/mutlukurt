# Hi, I‚Äôm Mutlu Kurt

I‚Äôm a Modern Web & Frontend Developer building fast, scalable, and user-focused digital products. My work combines traditional coding, AI-assisted workflows, and no-code/low-code platforms to deliver solutions that are both technically robust and visually engaging.

What I Do
	‚Ä¢	Web Development ‚Üí Responsive websites & apps (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend Engineering ‚Üí Clean, accessible, and performance-driven UIs
	‚Ä¢	UI/UX Design ‚Üí Prototyping and design with Figma & Framer
	‚Ä¢	Prompt Engineering ‚Üí Writing effective instructions for AI to generate code, content, and workflows
	‚Ä¢	No-Code/Low-Code Development ‚Üí Rapid prototyping & deployment with Cursor, Bolt, and Lovable

What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear, structured instructions for AI systems to produce accurate, reliable, and usable outputs. I apply this in software development by guiding AI tools to generate production-ready code, optimized UI elements, and automated workflows‚Äîmaking development faster without sacrificing quality.

No-Code & Low-Code Development

Using modern platforms like Framer, Bolt, and Lovable, I accelerate the development of MVPs and digital products. This approach reduces time-to-market, ensures scalability, and allows businesses to validate ideas quickly while keeping technical flexibility.

My Goal

To build products that are not only functional but also delightful to use‚Äîmerging code, design, and AI into clean, professional, and scalable digital experiences.
