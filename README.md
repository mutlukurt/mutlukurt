# Hi, I'm Mutlu Kurt 👋

I’m a **Vibe Coder** — blending structured thinking with creative flow to build products that are fast ⚡, clean ✨, and scalable 📈.  
Instead of writing every line by hand, I work side-by-side with AI 🤖 to turn ideas into real, polished applications — quickly and without sacrificing quality.

On this GitHub, you’ll find:
- Mobile apps built with **React Native (Expo)**
- Sleek, responsive UIs with **Tailwind CSS**
- AI-assisted development workflows for speed and precision
- Projects focused on usability, performance, and design

For me, building software isn’t just about code — it’s about creating experiences people love to use ❤️.  
I’m currently focused on developing my own products 🚀 and collaborating on projects that value creativity, innovation, and speed.

## 🚀 What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a hybrid way of building software — not pure no-code, not full traditional coding.  
It’s about **working with AI and visual tools** through logic, structure, and flow to create real, production-ready applications — faster than ever.

As a **Vibe Coder**, I:
- Generate frontend code and logic via **structured prompts**  
- Build MVPs, dashboards, and mobile apps in record time  
- Focus on usability, accessibility, and clarity — not just syntax  
- Bridge **creativity** with **technical execution**

## 💡 What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** means crafting clear, structured instructions that guide AI to perform developer-level tasks.  
I use it to:
- Build working React components and logic from natural language  
- Design UIs directly through prompts and flow-based editors  
- Automate repetitive dev tasks  
- Turn ideas into working products — fast

## 🛠 What I Do

- **Vibe Coding:** Building full-stack apps with **Cursor AI**, **Bolt.new**, and other AI-assisted tools
- **Prompt-Based Development:** Using natural language to generate and refine production-ready code
- **Frontend + Mobile:** Using **React**, **React Native**, **Expo**, **Tailwind CSS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for custom UI/UX
- **Rapid Prototyping & MVPs:** Turning ideas into polished, testable products in record time
