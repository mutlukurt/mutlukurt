# Hi, I'm Mutlu Kurt 

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a **Vibe Coder**, **Prompt Engineer**, and **AI-Enhanced Developer** who builds fast, scalable, and clean digital products using **vibe coding editors**, structured prompts, and modern frontend tools.

I don’t just write code — I **guide AI to build** with me.  
With **vibe coding**, I combine the flow of creativity with the structure of engineering to create smart apps that launch fast and scale effortlessly.

##  What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a hybrid approach to building software — not quite no-code, not fully traditional coding.  
It’s about communicating with AI or visual tools through logic, structure, and flow — enabling developers to create real, scalable applications at high speed.

As a **Vibe Coder**, I use modern AI-powered or visual-first platforms to:

-  Generate frontend code and logic via prompts or flow editors  
-  Build MVPs, tools, dashboards, and mobile apps faster than hand-coding  
-  Focus on usability, accessibility, and clarity — not syntax  
-  Bridge creativity with technical execution

##  What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of crafting structured instructions that guide AI to perform developer-level tasks.  
Instead of writing every line of code manually, I:

- Write prompts that generate working React components and logic  
- Build smart layouts and UIs directly through language  
- Automate tedious dev workflows with structured commands  
- Turn ideas into products — rapidly and intelligently

##  What I Do

- **Vibe Coding:**  
  Building full-stack apps with modern AI/logic editors like **Cursor AI**, **Bubble**, **Lovable.dev**, and **Bolt.new**.

- **Prompt-Based Development:**  
  Using natural language to generate and refine real, production-ready code.

- **No-Code/Low-Code Solutions:**  
  Designing fast, user-friendly apps without reinventing the wheel.

- **Frontend + Mobile:**  
  Using **React**, **React Native**, **Expo**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to extend projects with custom UI/UX where needed.

- **Rapid Prototyping & MVPs:**  
  Turning ideas into polished interfaces and testable products in record time.
