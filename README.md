# Hi, I'm Mutlu Kurt 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a **No-Code/Low-Code Developer** and **Prompt Engineer** focused on building clean, scalable, and user-friendly digital products using modern visual development platforms and AI-powered workflows.

Instead of relying solely on traditional hand-coding, I use tools like **Cursor AI**, **Bubble.io**, **Lovable.dev**, and **Bolt.new** to bring projects to life — fast, accessible, and future-ready.

## 🧠 What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the art and science of communicating effectively with AI models to get accurate, useful, and creative results.  
As a **Prompt Engineer**, I design precise instructions (prompts) that guide tools like **Cursor AI** to:
- Generate working code structures
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build complex logic visually
- Prototype apps without manual coding

This allows faster development cycles, better scalability, and smarter interfaces — ideal for startups, MVPs, and lean teams.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **No-Code Development:**  
  Build full-featured web apps, landing pages, and tools without writing code manually

- **Prompt-Based Development:**  
  Use AI tools like Cursor AI to structure frontend layouts, components, and logic visually

- **Frontend (Low-Code) Integration:**  
  Add custom functionality using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, or **React** where needed

- **Rapid Prototyping & MVP Building:**  
  Deliver scalable solutions quickly for testing and feedback
