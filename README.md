## Introduction

I’m an **AI-Native Frontend Developer based in Turkey**, working at the intersection of  
**modern frontend engineering, AI-first workflows, and agent-assisted development**.

My focus is not only on *what* is built, but *how* it is built:

- faster iteration cycles  
- clearer intent → output pipelines  
- systems that scale in complexity without losing clarity  

I approach frontend development as a **system design problem**, where AI plays an active role in ideation, execution, and refinement.

##  What “AI-Native” Means in My Work

AI-Native is not about adding an AI feature to an existing product.  
It’s about **designing the product, workflow, and architecture around AI from day one**.

In practice, this means:

- **AI-First Architecture** — interfaces and systems are designed assuming AI participation from the start.
- **Prompt-Driven Development** — prompts are treated as structured, reusable, evolving assets (similar to code).
- **Agentic Coding** — I collaborate with autonomous and semi-autonomous agents to:
  - scaffold features
  - refactor components
  - explore alternative implementations
  - accelerate repetitive or exploratory tasks
- **Human-in-the-Loop Control** — AI accelerates execution, but decisions, trade-offs, and quality control remain human-led.

**Result:** faster delivery, higher creative bandwidth, and more resilient systems.

## What I Build

I specialize in building **AI-augmented frontend systems**, including:

- Intelligent dashboards and interfaces
- AI-assisted content and interaction layers
- Prompt-driven UI logic
- High-performance, scalable web applications

Every project prioritizes: **performance · clarity · maintainability · user experience**

## Working Philosophy

- AI is a **collaborator**, not a shortcut  
- Readability beats cleverness  
- Performance is a feature  
- Tools evolve — fundamentals stay  

I care deeply about building software that is:
**understandable today, adaptable tomorrow, and pleasant to use always**.
